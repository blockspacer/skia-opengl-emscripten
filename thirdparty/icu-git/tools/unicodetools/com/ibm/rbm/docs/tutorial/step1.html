      <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Setting Your Personal Preferences</H3>
      <P><B>Getting Started</B></P>
      <P>Before you can do anything with the program, of course, you have to get 
        it running. RB Manager is purely a Java application. The download does 
        not come with a Java runtime environment. In order to use RBManager, you 
        will need to hava a Java runtime environment installed on your machine. 
        The environment is available to most computing platforms at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">Sun's 
        internet site</A>. RB Manager has been tested for Java versions 1.2.2 
        and higher. It is recommended that you use Java version 1.3 if it is available 
        for your system.</P>
      <P>To run the program from the command line, first go to the RBManager directory 
        on your system, then enter:</P>
      <P><CODE>java -classpath ./lib/RBManager.jar;./lib/xerces.jar com.ibm.rbm.RBManager</CODE></P>
      <P>Alternatively, Windows users can use the batch file, RBManager.bat to 
        accomplish the same thing. Linux and Unix users tend not to need their 
        hands held, and can probably figure out how to write a simple script or 
        alias to run the application without help. Mac OS X users can run the 
        program from the Terminal application with the above command line, substituting 
        a colon for the semi-colon in the classpath argument.</P>
      <P><B>The Display</B></P>
      <P>Once you get the application running, you will hopefully see something 
        like this:</P>
      <P><IMG SRC="../images/screenshots/empty_screen.gif"></P>
      <P>The display may differ because of differences in the various Java Virtual 
        Machines and differences in Look and Feels. At the top is a menu bar and 
        a logo. Below the logo and to the left is a pane in which all of the various 
        language files will be listed in a tree view. Since no resource bundle 
        has been selected, this tree is currently empty. To the right is a tabbed 
        pane in which three views will be shown. The views will either present 
        information or provide an interface for editing the various data contained 
        across your resource bundle.</P>
      <P><B>Customizing the Application for You</B></P>
      <P>Go to the Options menu and select Preferences. The first time after opening 
        the application, it may take a few seconds to get to the preferences as 
        the application tries to get information from your virtual machine.A dialog 
        box should appear that looks similar to this:</P>
      <P><IMG SRC="../images/screenshots/preferences_dialog.gif" WIDTH="429" HEIGHT="269"></P>
      <P>The first thing to do is to change the user name to your own name. You 
        will only have to do this once unless someone else uses this application 
        and changes the name. Second, you should change the look and feel of the 
        application to your preference. All of the look and feels that your JVM 
        supports should be listed in the drop down box. (Note that changes will 
        not take affect until after you are done and have pressed the Update button).</P>
      <P>The last thing to change is the locale you would like to use to work 
        with this application. When you download RBManager, it is set by default 
        to display in U.S. English. As of this writing, you can use the program 
        in Finnish, Swedish, and German as well. Three lists choices are possible 
        for selecting a locale. The first, called 'Machine Supported', lists all 
        of the locals supported by your JVM. The second, called 'Defined for RBManager', 
        analyzes the Resource Bundle for RBManager and lets you select from the 
        available translation files. The third option, called 'ISO Standards', 
        lists all of the language and country 2-letter codes defined by the ISO. 
        You may select any of the three options by use of the radio button on 
        the left and then select the encoding you would like to use. Of course 
        if the encoding you select is not supported by RBManager, the translations 
        in the base class of the bundle will be used, which are in English. Also 
        note, that the base class language may not appear in the 'Defined for 
        RBManager' section because the encoding is not always specified for that 
        file. </P>
      <P>When you are done making your personalized selections, click on the Update 
        button. The preferences will be saved in a file called preferences.properties 
        stored in your RBManager directory. You will not need to make these selections 
        in the future, unless you want to change your defaul options.</P>
