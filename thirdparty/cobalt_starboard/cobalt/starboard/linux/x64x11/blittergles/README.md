This is an implementation of the Blitter API in terms of the EGL/GLES interface.
This implementation enables the Blitter API to be used and tested on any device
that supports EGL/GLES. It is useful because high quality DirectFB drivers are
not currently available for many desktop platforms where it is easiest to test
and iterate.
