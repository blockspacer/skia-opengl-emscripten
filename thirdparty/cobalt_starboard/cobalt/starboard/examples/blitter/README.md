# Blitter API Example

This example application demonstrates Starboard's Blitter API usage.  It
demonstrates a wide array of Blitter API usages such as initializing a
blitter device, swap chain and context. It also demonstrates uploading textures
from the CPU to the blitter device, filling rectangles with solid colors,
blitting from a texture to a surface, rendering to offscreen surfaces,
and rendering using an offscreen surface as a texture.
