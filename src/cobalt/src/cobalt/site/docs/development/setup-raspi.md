These instructions explain how to set up Cobalt for your workstation and your
Raspberry Pi device.

## Set up your device

<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Raspberry Pi <em>cannot</em> have MesaGL installed and will return
an error, like `DRI2 not supported` or `DRI2 failed to authenticate` if MesaGL
is installed.
</aside>

<aside class="note">
<b>Note:</b> The current builds of Cobalt currently are verified to work only
with a fairly old version of Raspbian Lite from 2017-07-05 (
<a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2017-07-05/2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip">download link</a>
).  If you have a newer version, you may encounter linker errors when building
Cobalt as the sysroot system libraries will differ in the latest version of
Raspbian.
</aside>

The following commands update the package configuration on your Raspberry Pi
so that Cobalt can run properly:

```
$ apt-get remove -y --purge --auto-remove libgl1-mesa-dev \
          libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev
$ apt-get install -y libpulse-dev libasound2-dev libavformat-dev \
          libavresample-dev
```

## Set up your workstation

The following steps install the cross-compiling toolchain on your workstation.
The toolchain runs on an x86 workstation and compiles binaries for your ARM
Raspberry Pi.

1.  Choose a location for the installed toolchain &ndash; e.g. `raspi-tools`
    &ndash; and set `$RASPI_HOME` to that location.

1.  Add `$RASPI_HOME` to your `.bashrc` (or equivalent).

1.  Create the directory for the installed toolchain and go to it:

    ```
    mkdir -p $RASPI_HOME
    cd $RASPI_HOME
    ```

1.  Clone the GitHub repository for Raspberry Pi tools:

    ```
    git clone git://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
    ```

1.  Sync your sysroot by completing the following steps:

    1.  Boot up your RasPi, and set `$RASPI_ADDR` to the device's IP address.
    1.  Run `mkdir -p $RASPI_HOME/sysroot`
    1.  Run:

        ``` 
        rsync -avzh --safe-links \
              --delete-after pi@$RASPI_ADDR:/{opt,lib,usr} \
              --exclude="lib/firmware" --exclude="lib/modules" \
              --include="usr/lib" --include="usr/include" \
              --include="usr/local/include" --include="usr/local/lib" \
              --exclude="usr/*" --include="opt/vc" --exclude="opt/*" \
              $RASPI_HOME/sysroot
        password: raspberry
        ```

## Build, install, and run Cobalt for Raspberry Pi

1.  Run the following commands to build Cobalt:

    ```
    $ gyp_cobalt raspi-1
    $ ninja -C out/raspi-1_debug cobalt
    ```

1.  Run the following command to install your Cobalt binary (and content)
    on the device:

    ```
    rsync -avzh --exclude="obj*" \
          $COBALT_SRC/out/raspi-1_debug pi@$RASPI_ADDR:~/
    ```

    The `rsyncs` get somewhat faster after the first time, as `rsync` is good at
    doing the minimum necessary effort.

1.  Even if you have a keyboard hooked up to the RasPi, you should SSH
    into the device to run Cobalt. Using SSH will make it easy for you
    to quit or restart Cobalt.

    ```
    ssh pi@$RASPI_ADDR
    cd raspi-1_debug
    ./cobalt
    ```

    With this approach, you can just hit `[CTRL-C]` to close Cobalt. If you
    were to run it from the console, you would have no way to quit without
    SSHing into the device and killing the Cobalt process by its PID.

    Note that you can also exit YouTube on Cobalt by hitting the `[Esc]` key
    enough times to bring up the "Do you want to quit YouTube?" dialog and
    selecting "yes".
