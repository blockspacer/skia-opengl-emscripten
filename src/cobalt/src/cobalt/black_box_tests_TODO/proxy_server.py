"""Starts a HTTP proxy server.

The HTTP proxy server is an improvement over SimpleHTTPServer as it can handle
more complex requests and responses including HTTP methods like POST, PUT,
OPTIONS, and others in addition to dealing with CORS and chunked messages. This
is a modified fork of proxy.py from https://pypi.org/project/proxy.py/ that
includes some bug fixes.
