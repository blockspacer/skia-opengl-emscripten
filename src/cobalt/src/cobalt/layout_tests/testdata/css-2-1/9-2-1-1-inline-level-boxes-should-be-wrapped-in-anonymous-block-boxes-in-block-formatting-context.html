 | If a block container box has a block-level box inside it, then we force it
 | to have only block-level boxes inside it by wrapping inline-level boxes
 | into anonymous block-level boxes. The properties of such anonymous boxes
 | are inherited from the enclosing non-anonymous box. Non-inherited properties
 | have their initial value.
