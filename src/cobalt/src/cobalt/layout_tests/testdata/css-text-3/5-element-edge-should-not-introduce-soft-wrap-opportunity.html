 | Wrapping is only performed at an allowed break point, called a soft wrap
 | opportunity. In most writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a soft
 | wrap opportunity occurs only at word boundaries.

 | Element edge is an extralinguistic concept and as such should not introduce
 | a soft wrap opportunity.
