<!--
 | Wrapping is only performed at an allowed break point, called a soft wrap
 | opportunity. In most writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a soft
 | wrap opportunity occurs only at word boundaries. However, when the
 | word-wrap property has a value of break-word, unbreakable "words" may be
 | broken at an arbitrary point to prevent overflow, while still preserving
 | grapheme clusters.

 | On overflow, the first available break point will be selected. With word-wrap
 | normal, this will be the first soft-wrap location. With word-wrap break-word,
 | this will be at the first grapheme cluster boundary.
