// Enum for the state of a given caption property
enum CaptionState {

  // The property is not supported by the system. The application should provide
  // a way to set this property, otherwise it will not be changeable.
  "unsupported",

   // The property is supported by the system, but the user has not set it.
   // The application should provide a default setting for the property to
   // handle this case.
  "unset",

  // The user has set this property as a system default, meaning that it should
  // take priority over app defaults. If SystemCaptionSettings.supportsOverride
  // contains true, this value should be interpreted as explicitly saying
  // "do not override." If it contains false, it is up to the application to
  // intepret any additional meaning of this value.
  "set",

  // This property should take priority over everything but application-level
  // overrides, including video caption data.  If
  // SystemCaptionSettings.supportsOverride contains false, then no attributes
  // will ever contain this value.
  "override",
