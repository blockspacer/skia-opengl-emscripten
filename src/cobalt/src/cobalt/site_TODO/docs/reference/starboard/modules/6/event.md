```

The first event that a Starboard application receives is either `Start`
(`kSbEventTypeStart`) or `Preload` (`kSbEventTypePreload`). `Start` puts the
application in the `STARTED` state, whereas `Preload` puts the application in
the `PRELOADING` state.

`PRELOADING` can only happen as the first application state. In this state, the
application should start and run as normal, but will not receive any input, and
should not try to initialize graphics resources (via GL or `SbBlitter`). In
`PRELOADING`, the application can receive `Start` or `Suspend` events. `Start`
will receive the same data that was passed into `Preload`.

In the `STARTED` state, the application is in the foreground and can expect to
do all of the normal things it might want to do. Once in the `STARTED` state, it
may receive a `Pause` event, putting the application into the `PAUSED` state.

In the `PAUSED` state, the application is still visible, but has lost focus, or
it is partially obscured by a modal dialog, or it is on its way to being shut
down. The application should pause activity in this state. In this state, it can
receive `Unpause` to be brought back to the foreground state (`STARTED`), or
`Suspend` to be pushed further in the background to the `SUSPENDED` state.

In the `SUSPENDED` state, the application is generally not visible. It should
immediately release all graphics and video resources, and shut down all
background activity (timers, rendering, etc). Additionally, the application
should flush storage to ensure that if the application is killed, the storage
will be up-to-date. The application may be killed at this point, but will
ideally receive a `Stop` event for a more graceful shutdown.

Note that the application is always expected to transition through `PAUSED` to
`SUSPENDED` before receiving `Stop` or being killed.

## Enums ##

### SbEventType ###

An enumeration of all possible event types dispatched directly by the system.
Each event is accompanied by a void* data argument, and each event must define
the type of the value pointed to by that data argument, if any.

#### Values ####

*   `kSbEventTypePreload`

    Applications should perform initialization and prepare to react to
    subsequent events, but must not initialize any graphics resources (through
    GL or SbBlitter). The intent of this event is to allow the application to do
    as much work as possible ahead of time, so that when the application is
    first brought to the foreground, it's as fast as a resume.

    The `kSbEventTypeStart` event may be sent at any time, regardless of
    initialization state. Input events will not be sent in the `PRELOADING`
    state. This event will only be sent once for a given process launch.
    SbEventStartData is passed as the data argument.

    The system may send `kSbEventTypeSuspend` in `PRELOADING` if it wants to
    push the app into a lower resource consumption state. Applications can alo
    call SbSystemRequestSuspend() when they are done preloading to request this.
*   `kSbEventTypeStart`

    The first event that an application receives on startup when starting
    normally (i.e. not being preloaded). Applications should perform
    initialization, start running, and prepare to react to subsequent events.
    Applications that wish to run and then exit must call
    `SbSystemRequestStop()` to terminate. This event will only be sent once for
    a given process launch. `SbEventStartData` is passed as the data argument.
    In case of preload, the `SbEventStartData` will be the same as what was
    passed to `kSbEventTypePreload`.
*   `kSbEventTypePause`

    A dialog will be raised or the application will otherwise be put into a
    background-but-visible or partially-obscured state (PAUSED). Graphics and
    video resources will still be available, but the application should pause
    foreground activity like animations and video playback. Can only be received
    after a Start event. The only events that should be dispatched after a Pause
    event are Unpause or Suspend. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeUnpause`

    The application is returning to the foreground (STARTED) after having been
    put in the PAUSED (e.g. partially-obscured) state. The application should
    unpause foreground activity like animations and video playback. Can only be
    received after a Pause or Resume event. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeSuspend`

    The operating system will put the application into a Suspended state after
    this event is handled. The application is expected to stop periodic
    background work, release ALL graphics and video resources, and flush any
    pending SbStorage writes. Some platforms will terminate the application if
    work is done or resources are retained after suspension. Can only be
    received after a Pause event. The only events that should be dispatched
    after a Suspend event are Resume or Stop. On some platforms, the process may
    also be killed after Suspend without a Stop event. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeResume`

    The operating system has restored the application to the PAUSED state from
    the SUSPENDED state. This is the first event the application will receive
    coming out of SUSPENDED, and it will only be received after a Suspend event.
    The application will now be in the PAUSED state. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeStop`

    The operating system will shut the application down entirely after this
    event is handled. Can only be recieved after a Suspend event, in the
    SUSPENDED state. No data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeInput`

    A user input event, including keyboard, mouse, gesture, or something else.
    SbInputData (from input.h) is passed as the data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeUser`

    A user change event, which means a new user signed-in or signed-out, or the
    current user changed. No data argument, call SbUserGetSignedIn() and
    SbUserGetCurrent() to get the latest changes.
*   `kSbEventTypeLink`

    A navigational link has come from the system, and the application should
    consider handling it by navigating to the corresponding application
    location. The data argument is an application-specific, null-terminated
    string.
*   `kSbEventTypeVerticalSync`

    The beginning of a vertical sync has been detected. This event is very
    timing-sensitive, so as little work as possible should be done on the main
    thread if the application wants to receive this event in a timely manner. No
    data argument.
*   `kSbEventTypeNetworkDisconnect`

    The platform has detected a network disconnection. The platform should make
    a best effort to send an event of this type when the network disconnects,
    but there are likely to be cases where the platform cannot detect the
    disconnection (e.g. if the connection is via a powered hub which becomes
    disconnected), so the current network state cannot always be inferred from
    the sequence of Connect/Disconnect events.
*   `kSbEventTypeNetworkConnect`

    The platform has detected a network connection. This event may be sent at
    application start-up, and should always be sent if the network reconnects
    since a disconnection event was sent.
*   `kSbEventTypeScheduled`

    An event type reserved for scheduled callbacks. It will only be sent in
    response to an application call to SbEventSchedule(), and it will call the
    callback directly, so SbEventHandle should never receive this event
    directly. The data type is an internally-defined structure.
*   `kSbEventTypeAccessiblitySettingsChanged`

    The platform's accessibility settings have changed. The application should
    query the accessibility settings using the appropriate APIs to get the new
    settings. Note this excludes captions settings changes, which causes
    kSbEventTypeAccessibilityCaptionSettingsChanged to fire.
*   `kSbEventTypeLowMemory`

    An optional event that platforms may send to indicate that the application
    may soon be terminated (or crash) due to low memory availability. The
    application may respond by reducing memory consumption by running a Garbage
    Collection, flushing caches, or something similar. There is no requirement
    to respond to or handle this event, it is only advisory.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardShown`

    The platform has shown the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard show method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the show method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowShowOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardHidden`

    The platform has hidden the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard hide method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the hide method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowHideOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardFocused`

    The platform has focused the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard focus method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the focus method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowFocusOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeOnScreenKeyboardBlurred`

    The platform has blurred the on screen keyboard. This event is triggered by
    the system or by the application's OnScreenKeyboard blur method. The event
    has int data representing a ticket. The ticket is used by the application to
    mark individual calls to the blur method as successfully completed. Events
    triggered by the application have tickets passed in via
    SbWindowBlurOnScreenKeyboard. System-triggered events have ticket value
    kSbEventOnScreenKeyboardInvalidTicket.
*   `kSbEventTypeAccessibilityCaptionSettingsChanged`

    One or more of the fields returned by SbAccessibilityGetCaptionSettings has
    changed.

## Typedefs ##

### SbEventCallback ###

A function that can be called back from the main Starboard event pump.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef void(* SbEventCallback) (void *context)
```

### SbEventDataDestructor ###

A function that will cleanly destroy an event data instance of a specific type.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef void(* SbEventDataDestructor) (void *data)
```

### SbEventId ###

An ID that can be used to refer to a scheduled event.

#### Definition ####

```
typedef uint32_t SbEventId
```

## Structs ##

### SbEvent ###

Structure representing a Starboard event and its data.

#### Members ####

*   `SbEventType type`
*   `void * data`

### SbEventStartData ###

Event data for kSbEventTypeStart events.

#### Members ####

*   `char ** argument_values`

    The command-line argument values (argv).
*   `int argument_count`

    The command-line argument count (argc).
*   `const char * link`

    The startup link, if any.

## Functions ##

### SbEventCancel ###

Cancels the specified `event_id`. Note that this function is a no-op if the
event already fired. This function can be safely called from any thread, but the
only way to guarantee that the event does not run anyway is to call it from the
main Starboard event loop thread.

#### Declaration ####

```
void SbEventCancel(SbEventId event_id)
```

### SbEventHandle ###

The entry point that Starboard applications MUST implement. Any memory pointed
at by `event` or the `data` field inside `event` is owned by the system, and
that memory is reclaimed after this function returns, so the implementation must
copy this data to extend its life. This behavior should also be assumed of all
fields within the `data` object, unless otherwise explicitly specified.

This function is only called from the main Starboard thread. There is no
specification about what other work might happen on this thread, so the
application should generally do as little work as possible on this thread, and
just dispatch it over to another thread.

#### Declaration ####

```
SB_IMPORT void SbEventHandle(const SbEvent *event)
```

### SbEventIsIdValid ###

Returns whether the given event handle is valid.

#### Declaration ####

```
static bool SbEventIsIdValid(SbEventId handle)
```

### SbEventSchedule ###

Schedules an event `callback` into the main Starboard event loop. This function
may be called from any thread, but `callback` is always called from the main
Starboard thread, queued with other pending events.

`callback`: The callback function to be called. `context`: The context that is
passed to the `callback` function. `delay`: The minimum number of microseconds
to wait before calling the `callback` function. Set `delay` to `0` to call the
callback as soon as possible.

#### Declaration ####

```
SbEventId SbEventSchedule(SbEventCallback callback, void *context, SbTime delay)
```
