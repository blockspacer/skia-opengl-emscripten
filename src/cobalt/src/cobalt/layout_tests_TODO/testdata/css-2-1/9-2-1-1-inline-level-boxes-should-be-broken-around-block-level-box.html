<!--
 | When an inline box contains an in-flow block-level box, the inline box
 | (and its inline ancestors within the same line box) are broken around
 | the block-level box (and any block-level siblings that are consecutive
 | or separated only by collapsible whitespace and/or out-of-flow elements),
 | splitting the inline box into two boxes (even if either side is empty), one
 | on each side of the block-level box(es). The line boxes before the break
 | and after the break are enclosed in anonymous block boxes, and
 | the block-level box becomes a sibling of those anonymous boxes.
