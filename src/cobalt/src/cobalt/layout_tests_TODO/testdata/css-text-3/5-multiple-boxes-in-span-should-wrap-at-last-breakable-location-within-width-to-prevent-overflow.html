<!--
 | Wrapping is only performed at an allowed break point, called a soft wrap
 | opportunity. In most writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a soft
 | wrap opportunity occurs only at word boundaries. However, when the
 | word-wrap property has a value of break-word, unbreakable "words" may be
 | broken at an arbitrary point to prevent overflow, while still preserving
 | grapheme clusters.

 |
 | When no soft wrap location can be found and break-word is allowed, the last
 | grapheme cluster boundary that can fully fit within the width will be
 | selected.
