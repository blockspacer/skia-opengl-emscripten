# This file defines 'glsl_keys', which is an input to glimp's
# map_glsl_shaders.gypi tool used to map GLSL shaders to platform-specific
# shaders, mapping them by filename.  The 'glsl_keys' variable defined here
# lists all GLSL shaders intended to be used by Cobalt.  Make sure that this
# is included before including 'glimp/map_glsl_shaders.gypi'.
