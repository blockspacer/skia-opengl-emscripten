      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  FreeType


                      The FreeType Project LICENSE
                      ----------------------------

                              2006-Jan-27

                      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
            David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



  Introduction
  ============

    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.

    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')

    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:

     """
      Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """

    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.


  Legal Terms
  ===========

  0. Definitions
  --------------

    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.

    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.

    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.

    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.

  1. No Warranty
  --------------

    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

  2. Redistribution
  -----------------

    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:

      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
        (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
        the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
        documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
        original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
        files.

      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
        states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
        FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
        encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
        documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.

  3. Advertising
  --------------

    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.

    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
  with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
  fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
  its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
  software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
  conditions:
  (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
  README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
  unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
  must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
  (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
  documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
  the Independent JPEG Group".
  (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
  full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
  NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
  not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
  acknowledge us.

  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
  in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
  it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
  software".

  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
  commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
  assumed by the product vendor.


  ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
  sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
  by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
  that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
  ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
  of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
  the foregoing paragraphs do.

  The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
  The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
  ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
  by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
  patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
  legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
  support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
  Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
  So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
  code.

  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
  been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
  "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
  resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
  GIF decoders.

  We are required to state that
      "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
      CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
      CompuServe Incorporated."
